## What I did:

-Created story board.
-Added front and side photos of Darth Vadar’s head for building reference
-Constructed the helmet using a sphere cut into one quarter and then copied using symmetry.
-Added sphere for head and used sculpt mode to give further shape.

-Created a basic body using subdivision and extension of cube segments.

-Smoothed surface of body in sculpt mode as I felt like it gave more control than doing everything evenly.

-Added material/texture to make the character black and kind of shiny(I haven’t really watched any of the movies but I guessed that’s what he would look like)

-Copied body for Luke Skywalker as I wanted them both to have the same bubble shape. Added a neck and a more circular head.

-Also added a bit more definition in sculpt mode. At this stage my laptop was crashing at a rate that made it impossible to do anything so I had to wait for the lab to open.

-UV mapped a picture of Luke skywalker which took far longer than I expected as if it wasn’t done properly he looked extremely creepy, then he accidently ended up with mini pictures of himself on his neck which I took out but then put back in because I kind of liked how strange it looked. I didn’t really think making beautiful and accurate characters was possible in the timeframe so decided to focus on the rigging and animation.

-Downloaded flowers and a gravestone and added them to the scene, the gravestone for some reason kept falling past the scene in animation mode so I had to change its gravity/collision settings.

-Rigging the two characters took far longer than I expected, I enabled rigify, which as far as I could tell used the basic meta human bone structure but trying to attach these to the characters was very confusing and I ended up just using the meta rig, I think, I rigged both so many times that I honestly am unsure which rig is doing the work. 

-When I started the animation I realised that the quad which I downloaded had no textures or materials so you couldn’t see the 4 pieces of grass, I added 4 planes and extruded them a little as the quad surface is not 100% flat. This meant that the grass is slightly risen but I decided this was a thing to fix at the end if I had the time. I decided to UV map an image of grass onto these planes instead of creating it because I felt this would have a quicker rendering time than making actual grass.

-I added some materials to the buildings and then began to work with the cameras. The cameras were the biggest confusion to me, I simply could not figure out how to point them where I wanted them and kept getting lost in space leading to multiple occasions of frantic searching for over an hour for my entire world, trying to rotate them or move them at all was simply a nightmare when it came to time so I decided to just add lots of cameras and keep playing with them until I got at least one that worked.

-Ran into a lot of issues when I went to animation, with parents and the armature, weird things like the gravestone that I imported was dropping and the flowers were rising, setting object floors seemed to work.

-I rendered one animation on the UCC computer as a safety net and went home to work on more as this one had some issues. I did more animation and rendered it at home. This animation had issues with objects deforming too but in different places so for the final edit I took the good parts from each and added them together in final cut pro. I also added the audio here as it didn’t make sense to do it in blender because I would be splitting the clips.

##Key things required for the project

## MODELLING
### AVATARS:
-A minimum of two original (modelled by me) humanoid characters
-Mustbe h-anim compatible as much as is feasible for my humanoid avatars
-Smoothen the Surface Mesh

### LIGHTING:
-3-point lighting and
-Environment lighting

### TEXTURING:
-UV Image Wrapping,
-Bump mapping,
-Images with transparency,
-An example of procedural texturing

### ANIMATION:
-Armature for 2 required avatars
-Inverse Kinematics to drive the animation
-Keyframe animation to capture and interpolate the poses

## COMPOSITION:
I was required to composite the animation with images or a movie in the scene
Had to include examples of:
- Colour Correction
- Matting
- 3 different Filter nodes

## OTHER:
-Incorporate some 3D Text
-can use 3D Model of the UCC Quad
