As a professional in **UX design** and **web development**, ensuring digital content is accessible to everyone has always been a priority for me. But I wanted to deepen my knowledge and formalise my expertise, so I decided to pursue the **Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC)** certification from the **International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP)**.

The CPACC is widely recognised as a standard for those working in digital accessibility, and earning it felt like an important step in my career. Here, I’ll share my experience preparing for and sitting the exam, and how the certification has impacted my work.

## Why I Chose the CPACC

As digital spaces grow, accessibility is more critical than ever. Whether it’s ensuring websites are usable by people with visual or hearing impairments, or making content easy to navigate for those with cognitive challenges, accessibility plays a key role in building inclusive user experiences.

For me, the CPACC certification was an opportunity to formalise my understanding of accessibility principles and prove my commitment to creating better, more inclusive digital products. It’s not just a qualification; it’s a way to stay at the forefront of accessibility standards and continue to deliver high-quality, user-centred solutions.

## The Preparation Process

Preparing for the CPACC exam involved a deep dive into several key areas. Some of the topics I focused on included:

### Legal and Ethical Standards

I spent a lot of time reviewing the **Equality Act 2010**, **WCAG guidelines**, and other relevant regulations. The exam tested not just the specifics of these laws, but also how they apply to digital content and how to navigate the complexities of accessibility compliance.

### Technical Standards

The core of the exam is understanding how to implement the **WCAG 2.0/2.1** guidelines. I revisited the principles of **Perceivable**, **Operable**, **Understandable**, and **Robust (POUR)** to make sure I could apply them to real-world scenarios.

### Assistive Technologies

One of the most interesting aspects of the certification was learning more about the technologies that assist people with disabilities. I explored screen readers, alternative input devices, and speech recognition software to understand how these tools support accessibility and usability.

### Accessibility Testing

I also gained hands-on experience with popular tools like **Axe**, **WAVE**, and **Lighthouse**. Conducting accessibility audits became a key part of my practice, and the exam tested my ability to identify issues and recommend improvements.

## What the Exam Was Like

The CPACC exam itself is computer-based, with 100 multiple-choice questions to be completed within **two hours**. I opted for the remote proctoring option through **Pearson VUE**, which was a smooth experience. The questions covered a broad range of topics, from accessibility laws to practical applications of WCAG principles, and tested both theoretical knowledge and real-world problem-solving.

I found the questions to be a good mix of straightforward and challenging. It wasn’t just about memorising guidelines; I had to think critically about how to apply them in real situations. Time management was key, as I needed to pace myself to answer all the questions within the allotted time. I was relieved to see my results right after finishing – and I passed!

## How the CPACC Certification Has Impacted My Career

Since earning the CPACC certification, I’ve noticed several positive changes in my professional life:

- **Increased Credibility**: Having the CPACC on my CV has boosted my credibility, particularly when discussing accessibility with clients, colleagues, or employers. It’s a recognised certification that signals my commitment to high standards of accessibility in my work.
  
- **New Opportunities**: With accessibility becoming a key focus for many organisations, the CPACC has opened up new opportunities for me to lead projects, conduct accessibility audits, and advise teams on best practices for inclusive design.

- **Greater Confidence**: The certification has given me a solid foundation in accessibility, which means I feel more confident when tackling complex challenges. It’s also motivated me to continue learning and staying updated with emerging trends in the field.

## Final Thoughts

The CPACC certification has been a valuable milestone in my career. It’s not just about ticking a box – it’s about deepening my understanding of how accessibility principles can be applied to create better, more inclusive digital experiences. It’s a reflection of my commitment to ongoing professional development and to advocating for users of all abilities.

If you're considering the CPACC, I’d say go for it. It’s a challenging yet rewarding journey that will not only enhance your knowledge but also contribute to building a more inclusive digital world.
