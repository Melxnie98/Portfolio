Coastal Ireland 
 
This composition covers the theme of Irelands beautiful coastal landscapes.
Because Ireland is an Island it has so many beautiful seaside areas worth visiting.
 
I took the photos over the las year, image 1 on the Ballycotton cliff walk in Co. Cork,
image 2 in the Cliffs of Moher Co.Clare and image 3 is a lighthouse on an island, also near Ballycotton.
 
The copyright “Take a walk on the wild side” is supposed to encompass Irelands famous wild Atlantic way
from the south west of Ireland to the north west of Ireland where these photos were taken, also the wild winds and scenic hiking routes found there.
 
Principals of good design followed:
 
Unity, Proximity, Underlying Colour:  : The foreground image acts as a background,
I drew the image and cut the shape of Ireland out leaving a transparent Ireland shaped hole with a solidcolour which the pictures sit behind. It aims to unify and focus the viewers attention on the images that havebeen grouped together.

Repetition: oceanic colours, blues and greens.
Colour & Value Balance: the light pink background image aims to contrast the darker and more
visually weighted photos of the coast, I chose a lighter colour as it really highlighted the dark blues. Originally I used a green background to represent Irelandhowever this didnt seem to sit well with the blues and the image looked overcrowded and there was no real focal point. After researching colours that go well with the blues I found light pink to be the most effective for the purpose I needed. 

Shape and Position Balance: The Ireland cut out is a large simple image that aims to
balance the smaller and more intricate images of the coast.
Proportion: This image attempted to follow the Root 2 Rectangle where two opposite sides of a square are extended to the length of the square's diagonal, with the text fitting in the extended section and the images in the larger square section, I have however not calculated how accurate it is!

lternation: two or more motifs alternate with each other to create a sequence or pattern.
Progression: change and gradual variation in common forms makes them more or less intense.
Can add depth and activity. 

Typography: The poster uses only one minimal typeface as there are a lot of strong colours and I found that more ornate fonts looked overcrowded, although this can be changed within the gimp interface, as can the spacing, size and colour of the font.
