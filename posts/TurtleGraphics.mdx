## The Interface

The interface contains the turtle canvas, which is used to draw the figures.
The control Panel is used to input information in order control the output 
figure. It has an order entry box to input the amount of recursive steps,
a length entry box which dictates the length/radius of lines and circles.
It also has size and speed sliders which controll the pen speed and pen width,
I had hoped to get this working while the program ran however i ran out of time
so in order for these to work they must be used before the 'draw' button
is pressed.
the draw button draws the figure with your inputs, the clear button clears your
screen and inputs and also resets the turtle. 
The dropdown menu allows you to pick from my list of figures.
I added a bright pink colour to the GUI but after some time I started to feel 
as though the colour was really affecting how the figures looked so I decided 
to settle for a less in your face colour to allow the figures to be the more 
visually stimulating part. For this reason i setteled for the light colour 
options lavender blush and AliceBlue.

I also considered having a background colour and pen colour option in my GUI
but I decided that because I put so much work into the pen colour change and 
the colour schemes of my fractals that I wanted them to stay the colours that
they were, I simply couldnt allow my cherry blossom tree to be green and blue!

**FIGURE 1** = Dandelion

This is a dandelion. I changed the angle and amount of lines in the original 
shape done in class.
It starts with a line and then breaks out into more lines at various angles 
with varying lengths. Reccomended input values: 5,300 
However, if pen size is increased a smaller order value is reccomended.


**FIGURE 2** = Triangular Sierpinsky Gasket

This is a triangular Sierpinski gasket.
The larger the length, the bigger the triangle. It draws smaller triangles of 
the same angle with various colours inside. 
I didn't really like the original as it was all one colour so I created it in 
a different file using a range of colours that I thought worked nicely together
and 'pen.color(colors[j%6]) to switch between them at regular intervals.
It is an equilateral triangle. 
Reccomended input values:5,500
A larger pen is nice as it allows you to see the colours


**FIGURE 3** = Square Gasket

This figure is based on the Sierpinsky gasket. This time it is a square
instead of a triangle.I originally had a fractal that  looked like a cross 
within a square but i wanted to change it a little This was acheived by using 
90 degree angles and one extra recursive line than the triangle. 
Similarly to the Triangular gasket I thought the lines on their own in one 
colour were a bit boring so I used a different file with a range of colours 
that i thought would work well together.
Reccomended value inputs: 4,300 A slight increase in pen size is nice!


**FIGURE 4** = Sacred Flower 

This is a symbol of Sacred Geometry which represents the cycle of life.
It is said to encompass the most meaningful patterns in our universe.
I drew this with a compass in school as a child so I really wanted to try to 
recreate it. I had huge difficulty with making this figure as maths is not my  
strong point and the beginning of the new section  of circle starts between the
radius length and the radiuslength*2 but I eventually managed to calculate the 
right distances. 
Reccomended input values: 3,80 The length value should be lower as it is a 
radius meaning the size will double.
It also looks a little nicer with a bigger pen size


**FIGURE 5** = Flower of Life

This is an elaboration of the Sacred Flower. This version has smaller versions 
of itself. It also leaves the trail lines to add more detail rather than using
pen.up() and pen.down(). I had planned to use seperate colours for each circle
like in the sacred flower. However when I tried this it took away from the 
design so i decided to go for a more simple colour scheme. 
Reccomended input values: 3,80

**FIGURE 6** = Andrews Cross

This figure is a recursive cross.It uses a recursive function and and 
then turns back on itself and repeats to give the design on two sides.
Reccomended input values: 6,500 
It is more detailed the higher the order number however this slows the process!

**FIGURE 7** = Levy C Curve

The Levy C Curve starts with a line. 
The line is then replaced with two lines and a 45 degree angle.
The more splits that happen the nicer the fractal 
Reccomended input values: 10,6000\nLength value must be high to see the 
detail as recursion effects the length.


**FIGURE 8** = Willow Branch

This figure is based on a willow branch. 
I changed the direction and colour of the fern figure drawn in class and 
added some white circles for the little fluff balls that they get in the 
spring! 
Reccomended input values: 5,150 - however this is pretty time consuming so for
a more speedy experiance 3,150


**FIGURE 9** = Snowflake

This figure is inspired by the Koch curve. 
I wanted yo make a less basic snowflake than the one we had made already 
so i used the samw recursive lines set at a different n angle to make five 
decorative points. 
Reccomended input values: 5,300(for detail) 2,300(for speed)


**FIGURE 10** = Cherry Blossom

This figure incorporates the basic tree figure and adds a flower originally 
built for figure 4. I decided to add the two together in order to get a cherry 
blossom tree because I started having fun and I think they are pretty trees. 
This was done by adding the circle figure from the circle.py file. I tried
to pick colours that match the tree in real life but theyse are quite light so 
I had to pick a background that allowed them to show properly.
Recommended input values: 3,200
