## INTRODUCTION
The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA) is Irelands the largest animal welfare 
charity. For the purpose of this assignment I will analysing the functionality and accessibility of their 
website https://www.ispca.ie , outlining the interaction styles used, clarity of information provided, 
overall ease of use, and adherence to both Norman's Principles and Schneiderman’s Rules. 
I chose this website as it has an extremely broad target audience (TA), meaning it should be accessible 
to all users regardless of any extra needs that they may have. The users of this website could be any 
gender, race or age-group as animal welfare is a universal topic. This type of TA is extremely difficult 
to cater to, there can be no reliance on prior knowledge, users may use computers once a month or 
have extra needs, therefore the interface must be designed with care. The main tasks that the user 
can perform on arrival to this page are as follows: Report cruelty, read rescue stories, donate money 
and rehome an animal.
## INTERACTION STYLES
Interaction styles define the way that humans and computers interact, because of this, they are one 
of the biggest contributors to a user’s general perception and enjoyment of the interface and the 
overall experience. ‘The interface is the intermediary between users and content, an interpreter and 
guide to the complexities of a site’[2]. The ISPCA selected traditional web application styles, menu 
selection, form fill I and aa hybrid ‘question and answer’ style in one of their form sections. While 
these interaction style choices are absolutely appropriate and fit for purpose, there are some issues 
with the ways in which they have been implemented. I will touch on these issues briefly here and in 
more detail in the design principals and rules section.
## MENU SELECTION
The websites navigation bar(NB) is an example of menu selection, it has a list of sections that leads to 
a dropdown menu containing corresponding subsections, a well-chosen style for the TA. A study by 
Alistair Sutcliffe and Antonella De Angeli [5], showed that menu-based websites were perceived as 
more reliable and less error prone than other types. It stated that the menu style was better for 
usability, information quality and served as a better aid to short term memory, reducing the need for 
user recall. Generally this interaction style allows the user to select an option, this action should then 
change the state of the interface in some way. In the ISPCA website the expected pattern is 
disregarded, when you hover over a section in the NB a dropdown appears but nothing changes when 
it is clicked. The user has to problem solve to come to the conclusion that the action is not allowed. 
It would be more clear and less clustered looking if the drop down menu appeared only once the NB
was clicked. There are sections where only one option exists yet the user must use the dropdown to 
access it, rather than accessing directly (see figures 1,2&3). The NB is not available on every page, and 
disappears when you scroll, which is highly confusing for users. Other than this, it works as it should
and is clearly labelled, allowing the user to rely on recognition rather than recall. 
## FORM FILL IN
This style is seen in the ‘make a donation’ page, used to collect information from the users. The user 
is presented with a series of fields such as payment and personal details, within which they input their 
data. It is an appropriate use of the style, well chosen for the TA as it is a relatively easy concept for 
users to grasp. The fields are well labelled, allowing the interaction to run smoothly and the user is 
made aware of which fields are compulsory in order to complete the action using ‘*’. The user can use 
the tab key to move between the fields, a notable ease of use feature associated with the form fill in 
style.
## FORM FILL IN COMBINED WITH QUESTION AND ANSWER
This is seen on the ‘report cruelty’ page, it aims to walk the user through the process of reporting a 
crime. This hybrid incorporates keyboard input for open questions and mouse selection for closed 
questions where the user chooses from a list of answers. It is laid out as a scrolling dialogue, a 
responsible choice as the user can see how much they have to fill out, minimising the likelihood of 
frustrating the user into giving up. It is easy to follow, allowing for a majority of the TA to complete 
the task with ease.
## DESIGN PRINCIPALS AND RULES
For the following section I will discuss how successfully the website adheres to both Norman’s design 
principals and Schneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules. I have grouped the principals and rules together 
based on similarity and relativity to each other. I will focus on Schneiderman’s usability rule further in 
the accessibility section. 
## VISIBILITY, SIMPLICITY & STRUCTURE
The ISPCA website once again shows a varied adherence to these rules and principals. A study by the 
Neilson Norman group showed that ‘Web users generally prefer writing that is concise, easy to scan, 
and objective”.[1] The home page of the website does not emphasise the content that it contains and 
the overall structure is quite messy, in particular on the home page. The colours are off-putting and 
difficult to read, unimportant information is distracting and takes up too much space while the 
important information remains unhighlighted and lost in the page. For example, the embedded 
YouTube video in the home page is too small for any user to watch, the information they wish to 
provide is lost inside such a small frame. The design is overwhelming and unclear.
A further example is seen in the horse rehoming section, which consists then donkeys and horses are 
a logical grouping. This is misleading to users, and could also result in harmful consequences for the 
animals as they have entirely different health requirements and general needs. Scenarios such as this 
show the impact of interaction design, separating unrelated information and organising content 
clearly is imperative to avoid misunderstandings.
## FEEDBACK, DIALOGUE, AFFORDANCES & MAPPING
As previously mentioned the NB is confusing, the manner in which it provides the user with feedback 
incoherent. The feedback principal states that a user should be informed of actions and changes in 
state that are relevant to them, in real time, through simple and easy to understand language, “ideally 
in a form that is unambiguous and that makes the set of options readily available so as to avoid mode 
errors” [3]. Another example of the NB flawed structure can be seen in the ISPCA Inspectorate section. 
Here there is only one option to choose from, it makes little sense to incorporate the dropdown menu, 
a more logical process would be to remove the drop down, and just have the user click on the original 
button. 
Many places in the ISPCA site do not score well on perceived affordance. Navigation links appear in
unexpected areas, and there is a clear lack of the same from logical sources such as names/headings.
However, other aspects of the page are laid out clearly, for example many buttons change the cursor 
to a pointer, indicating to the user that the object is clickable (see fig. 5). Areas such as the rehoming 
section (see Fig.6), show positive use of mapping and dialogue, as the link between performed actions 
and their respective outcomes is clearly laid out[2]. In this example the user is given a clear path of 
their decisions, allowing them to go back to earlier decisions and to understand where they are. A 
clear sequence of actions reduces the toll on short term memory, allowing focus to remain on the 
content. 
## CONSISTENCY
Many errors seen in human interface interaction occur when a user tries to perform a new task using 
the same steps that worked for another. The root cause of this is regularly linked to a lack of 
consistency throughout the interface. Tasks which are “related and share a common description of 
purpose” [3] should follow similar methods of operation and contain similar elements, this increases 
learnability allowing the user to focus their attention on the task they came to complete rather than 
on navigating the process of doing so. Consistency is lacking throughout the website, the NB is not 
available on all pages, sometimes the links come from images and other times from text, overall it is 
very heavy on user short term memory and requires a lot of energy.
## TOLERANCE, CONSTRAINTS, REVERSAL OF ACTIONS & ERROR HANDLING
The sites ‘make a donation’ page shows examples of both positive as noted earlier and negative 
aspects of these rules and guidelines. Once a user reaches this page it becomes very unclear how they 
can leave it. There is no way to find the home page easily, no suggestions or hints, they have to click 
things in a trial and error manner to find that the image is the only way out. This is frustrating enough 
for a user to close the page, it could quickly make them feel as though they are not in control of the 
interaction – there is no internal locus of control, which is likely heightened as this is a part of the 
website where their financial details can be accessed. 
There are very few constraints throughout the website, users can fill string data into fields which 
expect integer responses (see fig. 7), increasing the risk of user error. Applying a constraint such as 
error detection would hugely reduce the quantity of errors made, it would also minimise time wasted 
by users. The donation section informs the user if they have left required fields empty(see fig.8), this 
is a positive example of error handling and tolerance, however, it would likely be less necessary had 
they employed more constraints to the process.
## ACCESSIBILITY
The accessibility review of the ISPCA site was completed with the aid of WebAim’s accessibility 
evaluation tool. For the purpose of this report I will be focussing on the issues found as those are what 
I will be attempting to resolve in my proposed re-design.
## LANGUAGE MISSING 
Most of the pages in this website are missing a language identification, this identification is ultimately 
what allows a screen reader to decipher and read the pages content in the appropriate language. It is 
also a facilitator for automatic content translation to other languages. This is a critical error as it makes 
the page very difficult/unusable for both people who use a screen reader and those who live in Ireland 
but do not speak English as a first language.
## CONTRAST ERRORS
Throughout the entire website webAim notes very low colour contrast errors, this creates frustration 
and difficulty for users. A certain level of contrast is necessary for all users, reading the content in 
certain areas on this site is difficult even for people without any visual difficulties. This issue is 
exacerbated by the small light font used for the majority of the content.
## REDUNDANT/NULL ALTERNATIVE TEXT
Screen readers require alternative text to accurately portray the page. There are hundreds of noted 
errors in this area. Null alternative texts makes accessing the content through a screen reader difficult, 
it may mean that users won’t have access to the information that they need to understand the page.
Redundant alternative texts are also highly frequent, likely to resulting in the same information being 
passed to the user repeatedly causing frustration. 
## PROPOSED RE-DESIGN
For this section of the assignment I will be focusing on the overall accessibility of the page, because it 
has such a large TA that it is currently not reaching. The Universal usability rule places importance on
“accommodating users with different skills, knowledge, age, gender, dis- abilities, disabling conditions 
(mobility, sunlight, noise), literacy, culture, income, and so forth “[4], it aims to make technology use 
possible to all people, regardless of their background.
My proposed re design will attempt to improve the functions that appeared as problematic during the 
website evaluation. The overall re-design is a prototype and as such, will not have full functionality. 
My proposed changes and their explanations are as follows: 
## LANGUAGE PROPERTY, AUTOMATIC SUBTITLES & RESIZING VIDEOS 
The language attribute has a very simple fix, simply noting the language as <html lang=“en”> will 
allow automatic translation and it will also allow screen readers to instantly tell what language the
document is in.
Adding subtitles to the YouTube video makes the content accessible not only to those who may be 
hearing impaired, but also to other users such as the many people living in Ireland who do not speak 
English as a first language. Many people browse web pages in locations where it may not be 
appropriate to have a video playing loud, if there are no subtitles they are unlikely to continue 
watching. I will use the YouTube frame API which allows you to force closed captions using 
‘cc_load_policy=1’. Adding subtitles will enhance the accessibility, understanding and overall reach of 
the content. 
Resizing the video was also a necessity, as it was too difficult to see and was hidden at the side of a 
page. Resizing the video is more difficult than I thought as you cannot simply specify a larger width 
and height. This will have to be done using CSS. This process will increase the visibility, overall usability 
and simplicity, reducing user frustration.
## NAVIGATION BAR
The navigation bar was one of the pages bigger issues. It was over reactive and not available on all 
pages, there was no consistency and it was impossible to use with a small window (see fig 6). This 
makes obtaining information difficult for the users and leads to feelings of anxiety as they are not in 
control of the interface.
I will put the NB to the left of all pages. This space was previously unused so it will remove some of 
the clutter, it will also allow access to navigation without scrolling to the top of the page. This should 
improve consistency and visibility while reducing the toll on short term memory. 
I will also change the way that the dropdown works, only having a dropdown on sections with more 
than one option(see fig.1&2), which is outlined by an arrow. The dropdown will have an accordion 
style, expanding into the NB further, meaning that no content is hidden by navigation. 
## THEME SWITCH 
The theme switch will give users more choice regarding the appearance, dealing with the contrast and 
visibility issues discussed earlier. This will be a pop up menu, with options for larger font, a dark theme 
for people who may be sensitive to brighter colours, a theme oriented towards children with a larger 
font and more use of colours, and the original style. When a selection is made the user will be notified
to prevent confusion from accidental change. This will improve the accessibility for a wider range of 
users as a layout has been created specifically for their needs, whether that is larger fonts or a need 
for more stimulating visuals to aid attention span. This is a prototype so it will not be the most 
aesthetically pleasing, it aims to show how a widget like this could help.
## DIRECT EMAIL
I will also add a direct email option to the website, the existing website gives email addresses which 
the user would have to copy, open an email and paste to send a mail. Setting the ‘mailto’ attribute in 
a form will allow the user to simply type and send, reducing the cognitive load required to complete 
the task.
## CONCLUSION
As this site is aimed at the general public, any person from any background with any kind of extra 
needs is capable of giving an animal a good home. In some aspects the website does as it intends, it 
cannot be expected to have flashy visuals as it is a non-profit organisation. However it is certainly 
lacking in all areas of accessibility, from facilitating multilingualism, to screen reader accessibility. The 
fonts and colour schemes used make the use of the site extremely difficult for people with 
deteriorating eyesight or learning disabilities such as dyslexia. Many of the TA can simply not be 
reached due to these oversights.
The interaction styles and navigational aspects are functional, they do as intended and are reasonable 
choices, especially for such a broad TA. However, they do require a few changes to make sure that 
they are accessible to all and to improve on the ease of use. There are many functionalities that in 
concept are good but they have simply been carried out in a restrictive or illogical way. Overall the 
site is ok on first glance, it is not until you approach it from an angle of accessibility and usability that 
you begin to really see the issues. My prototype is a very simple implementation of these features
however, I believe the proposed re-designs could enhance the website in these areas if implemented
in more detail.
