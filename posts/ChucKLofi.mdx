title: LoFi music Generator
description: Created using ChucK programming language & MiniAudicle IDE

This was my first attempt at creating a complete chuck application, I later created one where the music could be paused and played/ different piano notes were tied to keyboard button presses,
however I can't seem to find it, I will upload it when I do. 
A link to the github repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/Melxnie98/LofiSoundGenerator).

There are 8 chuck files and an audio folder which contains the sound files
necessary to make the lofi sound and the drums.

In order to begin the application, just open up Machine.ck, start a virtual machine 
and click add shred, many of the files will not work individually, they have to be 
used through the machine.

The tempo for all of the application is controlled by the BPM class found in bpm.ck

The Midi.ck file - controls the arrays of notes that go into the instrument files
I chose (what I hope are correct key of cminor chords), after a lot of failing to read from 
a piano and midi note list. I didn't add any other keys because this took me a very long time
to do and other parts would have ended up suffering.

The first sounds you will hear are generated in the lofiSoundFiles.ck file which loads 
crackles and vinyl sounds that repeat for the whole app. The crackle is played at random 
using a random number generator give the 'old, worn-down' sound. The other sound tries to 
add the general 'tape saturation' feeling. These are both sporked 

the next file heard is the Bass file uses SinOsc, it was the Mandolin bass STK but that seemed quite harsh. I played with a few reverberation classes, PRCRev, NRev and JCRev but JCRev was the only one
that I could make fit the lofi feel so i went with that. 
The bass2 Class is a subclass of bass with a slight variation in a few things to make the application sound less boring. I don't like it much so there's a large chance I will not leave it in.

The drums are added next from drums.ck. The drums have their own class, within the class there are two functions called playDrums - function overloading, one which plays the snare and one which plays the kick, snare and hihat, they also get their notes from the Midi file 

The piano is an STK Rhodey Piano. There are technically 4 pianos which play in sync to allow for a chord to be formed. The array is split into an array of arrays [[],[]] the first is filled by the midi note and the second by its piano number. The pianos are sent to DAC left , right and just normal DAC. One passes passes through a reverberation effect JCRev and another to => ResonZ

The piano2 class is a subclass of piano, It just uses one of the pianos from the piano class and its own arrays.

The next step is to add the user interaction section, I will incorporate the ternary operator and more if else statements in that section of the project. 

Side note - I spell eighth wrong every single time I type it so for the whole app it is written as eigth because I spent so many hours searching for mistakes which were almost always that.
