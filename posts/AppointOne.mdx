description: Designed and developed a website for a mediation services company
date: 23 Nov 2023
---
Developed using Netlify with github, using next.js (Javascript) and CSS
Due to client confidentiality I kept a basic version of the website for my portfolio removing any client information.
This is not the finished product just a general overview to give an idea of my work.
