## Reasearch

### According to the World Health Organisation.
"Persons with disabilities face barriers in all aspects of the health system."
Levels of empathy are far lower than what is considered appropriate for providing patient-centred care.
Empathy is a complex, positive social skill.

It encompasses viewing the world from the perspective of another individual, including the emotional aspects of that perspective, and 
It implies a certain amount of concern and care for other people.

### VR & Empathy

VR has been showing increasing potential as a tool for the development of positive interpersonal skills, however the concept is still in its infancy

This goal of this study was to design and implement a VR tool which immerses its user in an experience that patients may face.

The finished product aimed to negotiate the current issues seen in the healthcare system

### Project Aim

1. Incorporate 360 video, ambisonic audio and haptic responses. 
2. Examine the usability and feasibility of this type of immersive experience as a teaching and learning tool. 
3. Examine how effectively this tool aids the development of empathy skills in ID nurses. 

### Project Design

Sense of presence plays a crucial part in arousing emotions and sense of realism in VR. 

The design was mainly concerned with maximising the sense of realism and presence experienced by the user during the simulation, to allow the development of empathy.

To simulate real world experiences realistically, it is necessary to supply information to multiple sensory channels, as this targets the mechanisms of perception in the human brain.
