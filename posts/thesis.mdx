### According to the World Health Organisation.
"Persons with disabilities face barriers in all aspects of the health system."
Levels of empathy are far lower than what is considered appropriate for providing patient-centred care.
Empathy is a complex, positive social skill.

It encompasses viewing the world from the perspective of another individual, including the emotional aspects of that perspective, and 
It implies a certain amount of concern and care for other people.

### VR & Empathy

VR has been showing increasing potential as a tool for the development of positive interpersonal skills, however the concept is still in its infancy

This goal of this study was to design and implement a VR tool which immerses its user in an experience that patients may face.

The finished product aimed to negotiate the current issues seen in the healthcare system

### Project Aim

1. Incorporate 360 video, ambisonic audio and haptic responses. 
2. Examine the usability and feasibility of this type of immersive experience as a teaching and learning tool. 
3. Examine how effectively this tool aids the development of empathy skills in ID nurses. 

### Project Design

Sense of presence plays a crucial part in arousing emotions and sense of realism in VR. 

The design was mainly concerned with maximising the sense of realism and presence experienced by the user during the simulation, to allow the development of empathy.

To simulate real world experiences realistically, it is necessary to supply information to multiple sensory channels, as this targets the mechanisms of perception in the human brain. 

Visual immersion came from 360º video content delivered through a VR headset, rather than typical 2D video content such as YouTube clips. In order to create a more realistic
soundscape within this VR setting ambisonic audio was employed. Haptic responses were also a critical factor in the design of this tool, as it has been shown that the more immersed and
present a person feels in a learning space, the more effectively that experience can facilitate
learning.

### Testing
#### Participant inclusion criteria ; 
1. Currently registered students of the BSc Nursing (Intellectual Disability) program; 
2. Studying in University College Cork;
3. Aged 18 years or older.

**System performance analysis:** Meta’s OVR Metrics Tool.
**Usability testing:** 10 Item System usability scale.
**Sociodemographic testing:** age/year/previous experience.
**Empathy Testing:** KCES-R

### Sociodemographic Results
- 100% of participants were female.
- Participant year of study was 64.3% second year and 35.7% third year students, with no participants to represent first or fourth year students. 
- Participant age ranged from 19 to 45, with the majority of participants between 19 and 21.

### Empathy Scales Results 
Pre-questionnaire showed extremely **high levels of empathy** in each of the student ID nurse participants.

Despite the minimal room for improvement, the results of the post-questionnaire showed that **after the VR simulation, the participants did in fact show higher empathy levels** in both sections of the KCES-R evaluation.

However, the usability scale was more useful for evaluation due to this extremely high starting point.

### SUS results
<img

Participants **unanimously agreed that VR simulation should be integrated** into the BSc Nursing (Intellectual Disability) course.

Result of **100% satisfaction** for both using the VR simulation to learn about clinical scenarios, and overall experience participating in the study.

### Open Ended Questions:
**Participants enjoyed the immersivity:**
“how real the whole experience felt”.
“how immersive it was . . . gives a personal perspective on real life experiences”.
“The level of detail and complete lack of distraction while watching the simulation is great for getting a full comprehensive understanding of various scenarios. I found it very enlightening”
**They appreciated the new perspective:**
“ completely different experience to someone with a profound or moderate ID ”.
Including understandning patient fear:
“I felt myself wondering if I was secure, I can only imagine how they may feel”.  

### Future work:
-Ensure that Video/Audio meet requirements for what you need, go through potential issues that may occur in the translation to VR, for example the empty seat.
-Haptic measurement system at capture time. 
-A higher order of ambisonics than FOA - would likely drastically improve aural immersion. 
-A second type of haptic device for the jerkier movements.
